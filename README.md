Progressive Web Applications (PWA)

## Description

This is a Progressive Web Application (PWA) developed to utilize Webpack, Service Worker, and a Manifest file to provide an enhanced user experience, including offline accessibility.

## Features

1. **Offline Support:** The application can be accessed and used even without an active internet connection, thanks to the implementation of a Service Worker.

2. **Localized Experience:** The application can be installed on your device, providing a native-like experience.

3. **Stored Processes (Caching):** The Service Worker caches the application's assets, enhancing its speed.

4. **Manifest:** The Manifest file defines the application's metadata, allowing it to be installed across an array of devices.
